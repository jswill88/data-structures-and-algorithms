This repository is for daily coding challenges in Code 301. Each day, make a new pull request to the master branch, and submit the PR URL in Canvas. Add solutions to the challenges, but do not modify the tests.

### [Reverse an Array](./401-javascript/arrayReverse/array-reverse.js)
#### Challenge
A function that will reverse the order of an array without using built in functions.

#### Approach & Efficiency
I worked out two seperate solutions. One using a for loop and one using recursion.

### [Reverse an Array](./401-javascript/arrayShift/array-shift.js)
#### Challenge
A function that will add a value to the middle of a given array.

#### Approach & Efficiency
I found the middle point of the array, then split the array with slice, pushed in the given value, and concatted the rest of the array.
